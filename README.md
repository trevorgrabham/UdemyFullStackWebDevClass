## A follow along with the Udemy course

Not my own code, just following along with the course material. Some changes may be made to the original material, but is still heavily inspired by the original course material.

### Learning Outcomes

Through this course I have learned how to set up API endpoints using Node and Express, how to work with a PostgreSQL database, how to create React components and how to connect them to the Redux store, and the workflow on how to properly structure and deploy full stack web applications.
